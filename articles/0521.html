          <br>
          Fly me to the moon,<br>
          When listening to music, I realize I'm quite a boring person,<br>
          But I don't want to be seen through, so I disguise myself as an onion.<br>
          My love is not pure; it's filled with anxiety and resentment.<br>
          <br>
          In front of her, it feels like all my base instincts are exposed,<br>
          All my efforts seem to seek rewards,<br>
          It even makes me question, is this true love?<br>
          If it is, is it a good kind of love?<br>
          <br>
          I like to leave with a no regrets, no turning back attitude,<br>
          But the answer always needs verification.<br>
          The past was incredibly lucky and incredibly simple.<br>
          <br>
          But from this moment, it's no longer the same,<br>
          Even after verification, I still can't be entirely sure.<br>
          I don't understand why an answer about my own feelings<br>
          Requires an outsider's guidance.<br>
          <br>
          It's not about being unable to see,<br>
          But about not wanting, fearing, uncertainty.<br>
          An answer I didn't wish for is hiding behind the door,<br>
          So I hide behind the door too.<br>
          <br>
          Leaving behind an ever-expanding jungle of doors,<br>
          Afraid to seek an answer,<br>
          I'm convinced that the person behind the door not coming out<br>
          Is the answer itself.<br>
          
          
            <br>
            
    
        </div>
