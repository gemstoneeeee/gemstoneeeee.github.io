            <br><br>Feeling that binds me, it's also this tenderness,
            <br>When I taste the bitterness of this tenderness, sweetness coexists,
            <br>And vice versa.
            <br>
            <br>Feeling that I've received much when many others are unaware,
            <br>Thinking, perhaps, I've done the same,
            <br>But is it ultimately good or bad?
            <br>
            <br>Tenderness, like spider silk, entwines people,
            <br>Tenderness, resilient, coils around my body,
            <br>Where my thoughts reside.
            <br>
            <br>Thinking, feeling joy, an indescribable satisfaction,
            <br>Like an extra reward, such as seeing more beautiful clouds on a rainy day,
            <br>Or getting your pants wet and simply taking off your shoes.
            <br>
            <br>So, in moments of happiness, there's also pain,
            <br>This thread that wraps around me reminds me of my mother,
            <br>My mother's love, binding me when I'm unaware.
            <br>
            <br>Maybe I don't want to harm myself,
            <br>But only awaken my senses,
            <br>Or escape the mundanity of the world to find a different mundanity.
            <br>
            <br>Yet, should I be happy or sad,
            <br>Excited or apprehensive?
            <br>Whenever gently dissuaded or threatened with tears,
            <br>
            <br>I must cross the thread to find the answer,
            <br>Perhaps I will never know the answer.
            <br>
