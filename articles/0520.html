        <div class="sub">
            <br>
            <br>The sheep were blown up to the sky by the wind,
            <br>And it's not just tonight that sleep is absent.
            <br>
            <br>The fireplace, holding fresh flowers, scorches every dolphin,
            <br>Under each surfboard.
            <br>
            <br>The tulip's display carries resentment and hatred,
            <br>Gazing obliquely at her nemesis day and night.
            <br>
            <br>Walking into the light, shouting loudly,
            <br>The sound unable to reach beyond the rays,
            <br>
            <br>We huddle, thinking this is the future.
            <br>But red is green, and green is the color of yellow,
            <br>
            <br>All colors vanish in the black of night.
            <br>
            <br>The shepherdess steps into deep and shallow mud puddles,
            <br>Cold, wet, and hopeless, she never knew she walked into the trap of fate.
            <br>
            <br>The sheep beckon to her, the moonlight bathes everyone,
            <br>Truth is the same, until the break of dawn.
            <br>
            <br>The tulip slowly unfolds, the fireplace loses its life to the sunlight,
            <br>Dolphins frolic and leap out of the water in the sunlight.
            <br>
            <br>So yellow remains a flower, green remains the grass,
            <br>Red and forever red remains the sun.
            <br>
            <br>The shepherdess's sheep no longer mimic balloons,
            <br>Landing safely on the ground.
            <br>
            <br>Only the deep and shallow mud puddles remain,
            <br>Evidence that a woman once passed through here.
